# WynnLimbo
Are you tired of sitting in a black box while queuing to join the prof world?

Do you want something to do while waiting? Then this is the mod for you!

When queuing for worlds, WynnLimbo will drop you onto a small island to explore and jump around on while waiting!

## How it works
When queuing for a world, wynncraft puts the client in state where it only has to spend minimal resources on it. In practice this means that no chunk data is sent to the client and that the server ignores almost all packets from the client. Here is where WynnLimbo comes in. It sends its own chunk and entity data for the client to load and therefore allows you to move around and explore the limbo.

The island was built by Barled, VireVeonix and _GoldenShadow and inspired by builds on wynncraft.
